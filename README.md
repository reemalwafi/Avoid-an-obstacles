# Obstacle Avoider Robot

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a simple robot capable of navigating a defined environment while avoiding obstacles. The robot is equipped with specialized sensors that detect any obstructions in its path. Upon detecting an obstacle, the robot emits an audible alert to warn users and initiate corrective actions.

## System Overview: Obstacle Avoidance
Obstacle Avoidance is a system designed to help individuals or machines proactively avoid obstacles in their path. It utilizes sensors to detect potential obstacles and triggers alerts to guide users or initiate corrective actions.

### Features
1. **Obstacle Detection**
   - The system processes sensor data to identify potential obstacles in the path, such as walls, objects, or people.

2. **Alert System**
   - Triggers appropriate alerts to warn users or initiate corrective actions.
   - Alerts can include:
     - Auditory signals (e.g., alarms)
    
3. **change path**
   - After detecting the obstacle, the robot will switch to another safe path.

### How It Works
1. **Sensor Data Acquisition**
   - Sensors continuously collect data about the surrounding environment.

2. **Obstacle Detection**
   - The system analyzes sensor data to identify potential obstacles.

3. **Alert Triggering**
   - Based on the detected obstacles and system settings, appropriate alerts are triggered.

4. **Robot Response**
   - Robot respond to the alerts by taking corrective actions, such as adjusting its path.

### Applications
1. **Autonomous Vehicles**
   - Assists in collision avoidance.

2. **Industrial Robotics**
   - Prevents collisions with workers or equipment.

3. **Assistive Technologies**
   - Helps visually impaired individuals navigate obstacles.

## OverAll
We provided our overall system needs, including both hardware and software, along with a detailed document outlining the system.
