# Obstacle Avoider Robot

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a simple robot capable of navigating a defined environment while avoiding obstacles. The robot is equipped with specialized sensors that detect any obstructions in its path. 

## System Overview: Obstacle Avoidance
Obstacle Avoidance is a system designed to help individuals or machines proactively avoid obstacles in their path. It utilizes sensors to detect potential obstacles.

### Features
1. **Obstacle Detection**
   - The system processes sensor data to identify potential obstacles in the path, such as walls, objects, or people.
    
2. **change path**
   - After detecting the obstacle, the robot will switch to another safe path.

### How It Works
1. **Sensor Data Acquisition**
   - Sensors continuously collect data about the surrounding environment.

2. **Obstacle Detection**
   - The system analyzes sensor data to identify potential obstacles.

3. **Robot Response**
   - Robot respond to the alerts by taking corrective actions, such as adjusting its path.

### Applications
1. **Autonomous Vehicles**
   - Assists in collision avoidance.

2. **Industrial Robotics**
   - Prevents collisions with workers or equipment.

3. **Assistive Technologies**
   - Helps visually impaired individuals navigate obstacles.

## OverAll
We provided our overall system needs, including both hardware and software, along with a detailed document outlining the system.
